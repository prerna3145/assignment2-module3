\textbf{Introduction:}

``Diamonds'' is an entertaining game where players bid to gather
valuable diamond cards for points. We're teaching GenAI the rules of
Diamonds, guiding it to develop logical strategies for gameplay. This
details our process of instructing GenAI to play Diamonds and improve
its bidding strategies gradually. Our aim is to enhance GenAI's
proficiency in Diamonds, thereby making gameplay more enjoyable. Through
step-by-step improvements, we're working towards making GenAI learn
strategic bidding and ultimately improving the overall experience of
playing Diamonds. In this process, we delve into the complexity of the
game, breaking down each aspect to aid GenAI's learning. By analyzing
past games and outcomes, we refine GenAI's decision-making processes,
ensuring it becomes a competitive opponent. With dedication and
patience, we're paving the way for GenAI to become good at this game of
Diamonds, creating exciting and challenging gameplay for players.

\textbf{Problem Statement:}
-Developing strategies for the bidding card game
`Diamonds' with GenAI It is a card game where players bid to collect
valuable diamond cards for points. Each diamond card has a score.
Players bid with cards from their hand. The one with the highest bid
wins the diamond card. The player with the most points at the end wins.

\textbf{Teaching GenAI the game:}
First of we'll have to start explaining the basics of this game, In Diamonds, players bid to collect diamond cards for points. Cards are distributed evenly. Bidding involves using cards from your hand. The highest bidder wins the diamond card. Points are added at the end to determine the winner.
 
1 Distribution
(i)Keeping diamonds aside:Remove the 13 diamond cards
from the deck and set them aside before distributing the remaining cards
among players. This ensures fair gameplay without diamonds initially.
(ii)First take out the diamond cards. Then, split the remaining deck
into two parts. Each player gets all the cards from one suit---like
spades, hearts, or clubs. This way, everyone has a whole suit to use
during the game which ensures fairness.

2. Gameplay To begin, shuffle
the diamond cards and select one. Player one bids using their judgement
of diamond card values. Player two follows, unaware of player one's bid,
using cards from their hand. After bidding, the highest bidder claims
the diamond. This process repeats for each round. It's a test of
strategy and estimation. The player with the most diamonds, and thus
points, wins. The value of the cards is based upon the series:
2\textless3\textless4\textless5\textless6\textless7\textless8\textless9\textless T\textless J\textless Q\textless K\textless A

For example,
-the card diamond card for first round is 5 
-player 1 has suit of spades and player 2 has hearts 
-let us suppose player 1 bids with 5 of spades and player 2 bids 7 of hearts 
-winner is player 2, gets the diamond card along with a score of 5

\textbf{Iterating upon strategies}:
Below our some strategies that GenAI and I came up with:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Value-based bidding} Always bid with the highest-valued card
  in your hand, especially when you believe it's likely to win the
  diamond card, we've to use the highest value so that we can get the
  diamond. Also is we're feeling like that our card is not the strongest
  and we're likely to loose the round, we shall use the lower value
  cards.
\item
  \textbf{Observation} Pay attention to your opponent's bidding patterns
  and adjust your strategy accordingly. If they consistently bid high,
  you might want to conserve your higher-valued cards for rounds where
  you have a stronger chance of winning.
\item
  \textbf{Risk assessment} Assess the risk of bidding high for a diamond
  card versus potentially losing points. It might be worth bidding
  conservatively on certain cards to avoid splitting points or losing
  out on other rounds.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Analysis and Conclusion Teaching GenAI:}
``Diamonds'' involves a step-by-step approach, beginning with understanding the game's basics,
including card distribution and gameplay mechanics. By implementing
strategies like value-based bidding, observation, and risk assessment,
GenAI develops decision-making abilities. Through iterative learning and
analysis of past games, GenAI refines its tactics, gradually improving
its proficiency in the game. This process not only enhances GenAI's
gameplay experience but also contributes to the overall enjoyment for
players.The game becomes more interesting as the computer adapts its
strategy based on what's happening in the game. To win, we need to mix
our bids wisely, adjust to changes, and guess what your opponent might
do next. It's not just about luck, it's about strategy and being one
step ahead of computer. By combining these tactics, we can increase our
chances of winning and have more fun playing the game!
